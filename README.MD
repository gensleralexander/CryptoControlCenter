## ![Icon](https://github.com/gensleralexander/CryptoControlCenter/blob/master/CryptoControlCenter.WPF/Resources/Logo48.png?raw=true) CryptoControlCenter

An App to keep track of your crypto.

### Note

This application uses
- [JKorf](https://github.com/JKorf)'s .Net wrappers for various exchanges
- [Syncfusion](http://syncfusion.com)'s UI Elements.

(If you clone my code and want to use the WPF-Application, you have to get your own Syncfusion license and register it at [App.xaml.cs](CryptoControlCenter.WPF/App.xaml.cs). There is a free community version available, which you can use if you meet the requirements. If you use the download versions or only the .Common-Project, an own Syncfusion License is not required)

### Download links
You can get your latest version from [here](https://github.com/gensleralexander/CryptoControlCenter/raw/master/Installer/setup.exe) via ClickOnce Distribution and Updates.

### Disclaimer and License
Please refer to the [License](LICENSE.md).
This App is designed for my own private usage. Claims for damages or other liability by using this software are hereby excluded.
Please note that all exchange-logos and names and their copyrights belong to their original owners. No copyright infringement intended.
